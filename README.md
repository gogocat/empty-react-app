## Awesome Search coding test

Our developer didn't finish the code of building a search app.
We need your help to finish it :)

**What you need to do**
- Create SearchInput component that make ajax call to the mock api `/api/search?q=[query]`
- Display the search result in ResultList component
- Each result should be a link, when click should show a javascript alert displaying the result text
- We want to reduce amount of quest, so start making api calls only user types more than 2 characters
- The result list should be update as user continue typing (like Google search)
- Please also help fix the test when run `npm test`

This coding test was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)  template.
